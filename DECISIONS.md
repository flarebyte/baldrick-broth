# Architecture decision records

An [architecture
decision](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/architecture-decision-records)
is a software design choice that evaluates:

-   a functional requirement (features).
-   a non-functional requirement (technologies, methodologies, libraries).

The purpose is to understand the reasons behind the current architecture, so
they can be carried-on or re-visited in the future.

## Image prompt for Hero Image

Create an image set in Elizabethan England that has a satirical tone mocking
the period’s social norms and customs. The atmosphere of the image should be
dark and cynical. The image should feature a noble’s servant named, who is
portrayed as a simple-minded character. He is obsessed with turnips, rats,
and lizards. In a fairly detailed alchemist workshop, he is busy stirring a
suspicious-looking broth in a big pot. We can see some tails of rats emerging
from the pot. He is smiling with satisfaction and he has one missing tooth.
